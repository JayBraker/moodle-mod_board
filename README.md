## What is Board? ##
The Board module for Moodle is a plugin that enables a post-it board activity for students.
This is a collaborative activity where the teachers sets out a number of columns with
optional names and then students add contributions to a column. Students do not see who has
posted what.

On the Board, Students can:
* add a new post with some of the following:
  * a heading
  * some text
  * Add A link
  * Upload an image
  * Embed a Youtube video
* Edit or Delete one of their posts

They can also do the following depending on the settings of the teacher:
* move their notes among columns
* Star someone elses post

The teacher can set up the activity with the following options:
* a closing date for submissions
* how the posts are ordered in a column, by date or star count
* whether posts can be starred - by students, teachers, or neither

On the board a teacher can:
* move any of the posts from one column to another
* Download a copy of the board contents
* Download a spreadsheet of submissions of the students
